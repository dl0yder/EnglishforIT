# Project Report: English for IT Website

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Project Title:** English for IT
*   **Objective:** To create a professional, single-page website designed to help users develop their writing and communication skills in English within the context of information technology. The website serves as an educational tool, providing clear, concise information on fundamental IT concepts and terminology.

## 2. Website Structure and Technologies

The website was built using a modern, industry-standard frontend stack to ensure a responsive, maintainable, and visually appealing final product.

*   **Core Technologies:**
    *   **HTML5:** Used for the semantic structure of the website, ensuring content is well-organized and accessible.
    *   **CSS3:** Used for custom styling to create a unique and professional visual identity.
    *   **JavaScript (ES6):** Used to create a dynamic and interactive glossary, enhancing the user experience.

*   **Frameworks and Libraries:**
    *   **Bootstrap 5:** A leading CSS framework was utilized to build a responsive, mobile-first layout, ensuring the website looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
    *   **Font Awesome:** A comprehensive icon library was integrated to provide clear and recognizable visual aids for each term in the glossary, improving comprehension and engagement.

## 3. Features Implemented

The website includes all the features specified in the project requirements, with additional enhancements to improve usability and professionalism.

*   **Header and Footer:**
    *   A custom header was created, featuring the **ISTEC school logo** on the left and the website title.
    *   The footer was updated to include credits for the work: **"Work done by Daniel Costa and Rafael Alves"** and **"Ciber 1-A"**.

*   **Content Sections:**
    The website is divided into four main informational sections, each providing a short, well-written text on a fundamental IT topic:
    1.  **What are computers?**
    2.  **How they work?**
    3.  **What is the most important part?**
    4.  **What are the components?** This section was later expanded to provide more detailed descriptions of each key computer component, as requested.

*   **Interactive Glossary:**
    *   A glossary of over 20 IT terms was created to serve as a reference for students.
    *   The glossary is dynamically generated using JavaScript, making it easy to update and manage.
    *   Each term includes a clear definition and a corresponding icon for visual reinforcement.
    *   The glossary was extensively customized based on user feedback, with several terms being swapped to better fit the project's focus on IT security and networking concepts.

## 4. Design and User Experience (UX)

As a designer, my focus was on creating a clean, intuitive, and professional user experience.

*   **Layout:** The website uses a single-page design with a sticky navigation bar, allowing users to smoothly scroll to any section from anywhere on the page.
*   **Visual Design:** A professional color palette (dominated by dark blues, grays, and clean whites) and modern, readable typography (Google Fonts: Open Sans and Montserrat) were chosen to create a design that is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to read.
*   **Responsiveness:** The use of Bootstrap's grid system ensures that all content reflows elegantly on different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience for all users.

## 5. Project Files

The final project consists of the following files:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML document containing the website's structure and content.
*   `css/style.css`: The custom stylesheet for the website.
*   `js/main.js`: The JavaScript file that powers the interactive glossary.
*   `images/IstecLogo.png`: The school logo image file.
*   `report.md`: This document.

This project successfully meets all the specified requirements, delivering a complete and professional educational website.
