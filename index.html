            <h2>What are computers? How they work? What is the most important part? What are the components?</h2>
            <p>
                A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.

                A computer is a programmable machine that receives input, stores and manipulates data, and provides output in a useful format.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most important part of a computer is the central processing unit (CPU), or microprocessor. It is the "brain" of the computer. It performs all the calculations and executes all the instructions.
